# Magic NFT Starter Kit - Frontend Guide

This guide is meant to walk you through how [this site](https://nextjs-nft-template.magic.link) works and how you can customize and build on top of it to create your own project.

[Magic](https://magic.link) makes it super simple to spin up secure, non-custodial wallets for users while also supporting third party wallets. This NFT Starter Kit illustrates how to integrate [Magic Connect](https://magic.link/connect) with a basic NFT site that allows users to mint and view NFTs from a particular NFT collection. The guide below walks through the Magic Connect integration as well as the remaining items that may be new for developers just getting into Web3 (e.g. connecting to the Ethereum network, reading data from the network, submitting transactions, etc.)

## Magic Connect

[Magic Connect](https://magic.link/connect) is a seamless, single sign-on solution for Web3. It provides simple onboarding, a unified wallet UX, secure transaction and wallet management, and streamlined on-ramp payments.

All of this backed by Magic's Delegated Key Management system. It's a non-custodial solution to wallet management that's both more secure and more user-friendly than traditional wallet solutions. This guide doesn't cover the underlying technology, but it's worth reading the [Whitepaper](https://magic-whitepaper-key-based-authentication-system.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/Magic+Whitepaper.pdf) if you're interested.

### The Magic SDK

The Magic SDK provides all the developer tools you need to get Magic Connect up and running.

In `package.json`, you'll notice that this site has the `magic-sdk` JS package listed as a dependency. Once the SDK is installed, you simply need to create an instance of `Magic` and use the appropriate methods from the [Wallet module](https://magic.link/docs/connect/wallet-api-reference/javascript-client-sdk#wallet-module-methods).

#### Create your `Magic` instance

The `src/lib/magic.js` file shows the first step to working with the Magic SDK: create an instance of `Magic` using an [API Key](https://magic.link/docs/connect/getting-started/quickstart#api-keys) from your Magic Dashboard and a config object. This site uses the config object to set the network to `Goerli`, an Ethereum test network that we'll be using throughout this guide.

```jsx
const createMagic = (key) => {
  return (
    typeof window !== "undefined" &&
    new Magic(key, {
      network: "goerli", // or "mainnet" or customNodeOptions
    })
  );
};

export const magic = createMagic(process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_MAGIC_PUBLISHABLE_KEY);
```

#### Use the Wallet module

The remainder of the app uses the [Wallet module](https://magic.link/docs/connect/wallet-api-reference/javascript-client-sdk#wallet-module-methods) `magic.wallet`. Specifically, the following four methods:

1. [`connectWithUI()`](https://magic.link/docs/connect/wallet-api-reference/javascript-client-sdk#connectwithui()) - displays the Magic Connect UI for sign up and authentication. This is called when the user clicks the button to connet or sign up. You can see example usage in `src/components/AppHeader.jsx` and `src/components/LoginWithMagic.jsx`.

    ```jsx
    magic.wallet
    .connectWithUI()
    .then((res) => {
      getUserData().then((data) => setUser(data));
    })
    ```

2. [`getInfo()`](https://magic.link/docs/connect/wallet-api-reference/javascript-client-sdk#getinfo()) - gets wallet info as an instance of `WalletInfo`. At the time of writing, this object has only one field, `walletType`. The possible values of `walletType` are: 
    - `magic`
    - `metamask`
    - `coinbase_wallet`
    - `wallet_connect`

    This helps you write code to support both Magic Connect and additional wallet providers. You can see usage examples in `src/components/AppHeader.jsx` and `src/lib/utils.js`.

    ```jsx
    magic.wallet.getInfo().then((walletInfo) => {
      if (walletInfo?.walletType == "magic") {
        // Execute code exclusive to Magic if needed
      } else {
        // Execute code for other wallets if needed
      }
    })
    ```

3. [`showUI()`](https://magic.link/docs/connect/wallet-api-reference/javascript-client-sdk#showui()) - once you're connected, you can use this method to show the wallet UI. User interaction is then handled by the SDK. Note that this *only* works for Magic Connect. If you support other wallets and the user connects with one of those, this method will throw an error.

    ```jsx
    magic.wallet.showUI().catch((err) => console.error(err));
    ```

4. [`disconnect()`](https://magic.link/docs/connect/wallet-api-reference/javascript-client-sdk#disconnect()) - disconnects from *any connected wallet*, Magic Connect or otherwise.

    ```jsx
    magic.wallet.disconnect();
    ```

## Interact with the blockchain

After you have initialized your Magic object, you can send transactions and read from your chosen blockchain network using popular web3 libraries like `web3.js` or `ethers.js`. In this demo, we are using the Goerli test network.

You can see all of the EVM RPC methods that Magic supports [here](https://magic.link/docs/connect/wallet-api-reference/javascript-client-sdk#evm-rpc-methods). In this project, we use the following methods:

- `getAccounts` - returns a list of addresses owned by client. Typically, this is a single address representing the connected user's address.
- `getBalance` - returns the balance of the given address's account
- `estimateGas` - generates and returns an estimate of how much gas is necessary to allow the transaction to complete

The syntax for calling these methods depends on the library you're using. This codebase uses `web3.js`.

### Use `web3.js`

For a comprehensive review of working with `web3.js` package, you should check out their [documentation](https://web3js.readthedocs.io/en/v1.7.5/). That being said, let's go through the way that this site uses it.

The starting point for working with `web3.js` is to create a new instance of `Web3` and an instance of `Contract` using the `eth` module. You can see how this is done on the site in `lib/web3.js`:

```jsx
import Web3 from "web3";
import { magic } from "./magic";
import { contractABI } from "./abi";

export const contractAddress = process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_CONTRACT_ADDRESS;

export const web3 = new Web3(magic.rpcProvider);

export const contract = new web3.eth.Contract(contractABI, contractAddress);
```

Notice that in addition to `web3.js`, we needed the `rpcProvider` from `magic`, the address of the contract we plan to interact with (provided as an environment variable), and that same contract's Application Binary Interface (ABI). In this case, the ABI is in `lib/abi.js`, but if you want the site to use a different contract you'll need to update this file to be that contract's ABI.

#### Call RPC methods

To call RPC methods (not smart contract methods), you can use `web3.eth` followed by the RPC method, as is shown in `lib/utils.js` when getting a user's ETH balance: 

```jsx
import { web3 } from "@/lib/web3";
...
// connect and retrieve the user's primary wallet address
const address = (await web3.eth.getAccounts())[0];

// get the wallet's current ETH balance
const balance = await web3.eth
  .getBalance(address)
  .then((wei) => web3.utils.fromWei(wei));
```

#### Call contract methods

To call contract methods, you use the instance of `contract` created earlier. This object has a `methods` field that you can use to call all of the available methods.

Contract methods are written such that the developer marks those that are read-only versus those that mutate data in some way. Any methods that involve writing data require a transaction, whereas read-only methods can be called without a transaction (and therefore no signature required from the user).

When calling read-only methods, simply use dot syntax to call the method, followed by `.call()`. For example, in `lib/utils.js` we get the user's balance of NFTs by calling the contract's `balanceOf` method:

```jsx
const tokenBalance = await contract.methods.balanceOf(address).call();
```

Methods that require a transaction can be more complicated. It's best to first get a gas estimate for the transaction by calling the contract method but then adding `.estimateGas` instead of `.call`. This will give you an estimate of the transaction cost, called gas.

Then you issue the actual transaction by calling the same method name and adding `.send`. `send` lets you add configuration options. We add the user's address and the estimated gas. Users connected to Magic Connect will have their transaction signed by the Magic SDK, while users who chose to connect with other supported wallets will be prompted to sign using that wallet's normal UI.

The return value will be a transaction receipt that you can use to get events emitted by the transaction. The example below from `lib/utils.js` shows the code for minting from the contract using the `safeMint` method.

```jsx
// estimate the amount of gas required
const gas = await contract.methods
  .safeMint(address)
  .estimateGas({ from: address });

// construct and send the mint request to the blockchain
const receipt = await contract.methods
  .safeMint(address)
  .send({
    from: address,
    gas,
  })
  .on("transactionHash", (hash) => {
    txData = { hash };
    console.log("Transaction hash:", hash);
  })
  .then((receipt) => {
    console.log("Transaction receipt:", receipt);

    // extract the minted tokenId from the transaction response
    const tokenId = receipt?.events?.Transfer?.returnValues?.tokenId;
    console.log("Minted tokenId:", tokenId);
    txData.tokenId = tokenId;

    return txData;
  })
  .catch((err) => {
    console.error(err);
    throw err;
  });
```

That covers the basics of how this project works! Feel free to browse the rest of the code to get an idea of how to use both the Magic SDK and `web3.js`!

## Use this template

When building something new, it often helps to build from an existing project rather than starting over. You're more than welcome to clone this repository and start modifying it to suit your needs. Just be sure to use your own IP for images, NFTs, etc. before publishing!

### Local setup

This is a simple [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) app with a few basic dependencies. If you need to get familiar with Next.js, check out the [Next.js documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/).

To start, make sure to install your dependencies with the following command line commands:

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
```

You'll then need to copy rename `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in the values it mentions:
- `MAGIC_SECRET_KEY` - get this from your [Magic Dashboard](https://dashboard.magic.link). You can sign up for a free account if you haven't already
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_MAGIC_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` - get this from your Magic Dashboard
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_CONTRACT_ADDRESS` - the address of the NFT contract you want the site to use for minting NFTs. You can use ours (`0x56A4664940E54920fF12C24030aCe0d6a333187d`) for testing on the Goerli testnet if you'd like, but eventually you should replace it with your own contract address.

With the environment variables set, you can run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

The development server will run on port 3000 if available. If port 3000 is already in use, it'll use another one. You'll be able to see which port is being used in the console.

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) (or whichever port the development server is running on) with your browser to see the result.

### Goerli Testnet

This template uses the Goerli Testnet so that you can experiment without using real ETH. Goerli is an Ethereum test network, or testnet. Testnets are designed to be as close as possible to the production network without requiring tokens to have actual value. That way, you can execute transactions, deploy contracts, mint, and generally just experiment, without fear of losing money.

Before using Goerli, you will need to first acquire some Goerli ETH. To do so, you can use a faucet such as https://goerlifaucet.com/. Faucets are sites that send you test ETH. At the time of writing, https://goerlifaucet.com/ requires creating an Alchemy account, but once you have an account you can get 0.5 Goerli ETH for testing. Once you have your Goerli ETH, you are ready to begin minting!
